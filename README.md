# NTU onearena 2023 working code
works. full marks for final competition. 6.0 min taken, one run through.

2nd fastest team for final competition. Ranked only 4th place because we screwed up amazing race. Unfair treatment because the 2nd team (from ASRJC) hardcoded it. respect++ because hardcoding is actually harder than my code. But still I'm not very happy because the final committee decided to accept hardcoding, while they did not in year 2022.

You need to change the first 15 lines of code to suit your robot. Cause some data can be different for each robot.

Also need to change action() method under Marker class, adjust the function code to how your current year competition is intended to be. (If you can't even understand what the function does... Just give up bro why are you even here)

Chat GPT doesn't code very well for robomaster, its syntax is different from what robomaster app uses.
